# NameGenerator
The idea for this project is pretty simple: create an application that given a starting letter can generate a number of name that starts with the given letter.
To achieve that, I trained a LSTM network using 2000 common American names. The results are quite satisfactory, the names generated seems palusible enough that someone
somewhere could actually have named their child like that.

## Dataset
The dataset consists in the 2000 most common names in the US (1000 male names, and 1000 female names).
